# Rashstrap

This is my little bash script for starting a new project. It creates a directory structure for Less and CoffeeScript files, initializes a Gruntfile with a few basic configurations, and installs npm dependencies.

### Install
```bash
cd /usr/local/bin && { curl -O https://raw.github.com/calebrash/rashstrap/master/rashstrap; cd -; chmod 755 /usr/local/bin/rashstrap;}
```

### Dependencies
- git
- npm
- grunt

### Usage
Run
```bash
rashstrap
```
and enter a project name at the prompt.
